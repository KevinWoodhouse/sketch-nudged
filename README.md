# Nudged

**A Sketch plugin to easily edit your nudge distance settings.**


### Install
Important - make sure you have the latest version of Sketch App installed. (**Sketch 41+** Required).


1. Download and open **[sketch-nudged-master.zip](https://github.com/KevinWoodhouse/sketch-nudged/archive/master.zip)**.
2. Double click on **sketch-nudged.sketchplugin** to install.

Alternately place the unzipped **sketch-nudged-master** folder into Sketch's Plugin directory.

To check that the plugin is enabled, open up the plugin preferences using `Plugin -> Manage Plugins...` making sure **Nudged** is listed and activated.

### Usage
Bring up the Nudged Settings Window either from the *Plugin menu* or via *keyboard shortcut*. Edit both/either fields with your custom nudge distance settings and click the *Apply Button* to save.

These are global settings, so adjust on the fly for each Sketch project's use case.


### Keyboard Shortcuts
You can quickly access the Nudged Settings Window by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>.

Use standard Sketch App keys to Nudge objects around:

**Small Nudge** : <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd>  
**Big Nudge** : <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd>
